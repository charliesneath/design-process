## Project Overview

- Deadlines
- Goals
- Number of design iterations
- Other projects competing for time
- Will there be testing? What kind of iteration cycle happens as a result?

## Research

- What are similar examples?
- What are the common patterns?
- What are the pros and cons of existing approaches?
- How does the context of existing approaches differ from our current context?
- What graphic design elements are similar between the different approaches?
- What is the interaction model being used to drive the layout decisions?

## Interviews 
- What biases currently exist that will influence the work?

### Devices

- How does it work across different breakpoints?
- How does functionality differ across the breakpoints?

## Prototype

When there are interactive or motion elements involved in a design, prototypes help to understand how the elements will work together in the final product.

## Testing
- What needs to be learned?
- How will learnings be 

*After testing:*

What was learned from the tests?

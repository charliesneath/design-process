## Project Overview

- Deadlines
- Goals
- Number of design iterations
- Other projects competing for time
- Will there be testing? What kind of iteration cycle happens as a result?

## Brainstorm
- how is the brainstorm being hosted, and what is the intended outcome?
- who will be involved?
- what is their level of expertise?
- where do ideas come from, and how do they affect the outcome?
- which ideas should be incorporated into the process?

## Research

- What are similar examples?
- What are the common patterns?
- What are the pros and cons of existing approaches?
- How does the context of existing approaches differ from our current context?
- What graphic design elements are similar between the different approaches?
- What is the interaction model being used to drive the layout decisions?

## Interviews 
- What biases currently exist that will influence the work?

### Devices

- How does it work across different breakpoints?
- How does functionality differ across the breakpoints?

## Prototype

When there are interactive or motion elements involved in a design, prototypes help to understand how the elements will work together in the final product.

## Testing
- What needs to be learned?
- How will learnings be 

*After testing:*

What was learned from the tests?

## Reviewing Launch Candidate
- Does the structure match the wireframes?
- Is the content correct? 
- Have all breakpoints been checked?

## Mocks

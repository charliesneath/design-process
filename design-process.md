## Research

- What are similar examples?
- What are the common patterns?
- What are the pros and cons of existing approaches?
- How does the context of existing approaches differ from our current context?
- What graphic design elements are similar between the different approaches?
- What is the interaction model being used to drive the layout decisions?

### Devices

- How does it work across different breakpoints?
- How does functionality differ across the breakpoints?

## Prototype

When there are interactive or motion elements involved in a design, prototypes help to understand how the elements will work together in the final product.

- mocks

- specs
